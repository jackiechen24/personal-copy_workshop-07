Repo for ENVS 193 DS to practice forking

## General information
I (Jackie Chen) worked on this repo created by Caitlin Nordheim-Maestas to practice forking during ENVS 193 DS workshop on May 16, 2024. The data relates to comparing abalone growth to temperature, and it came from this repo and is part of the data folder. The abalone data was viewed, visualized, analyzed, and used for model prediction.

## Data and file overview
The data file is in .csv format, and it consists of the variables temperature (in Celsius) and growth (abalone growth). The data was accessed on May 16, 2024. The workshop-07_TEMPLATE_2024-05-15.qmd file provides code that looks at the data in greater detail, including visualizing and analyzing the data.
